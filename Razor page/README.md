# Razor page

## What is Razor?
Razor is a markup syntax that lets you embed server-based code (Visual Basic and C#) into web pages.

Server-based code can create dynamic web content on the fly, while a web page is written to the browser. When a web page is called, the server executes the server-based code inside the page before it returns the page to the browser. By running on the server, the code can perform complex tasks, like accessing databases.

## Razor Helpers
ASP.NET helpers are components that can be accessed by single lines of Razor code.

You can build your own helpers using Razor syntax, or use built-in ASP.NET helpers.

Below is a short description of some useful Razor helpers:

* Web Grid
* Web Graphics
* Google Analytics
* Facebook Integration
* Twitter Integration
* Sending Email
* Validation

## Razor Programming Languages
Razor supports both C# (C sharp) and VB (Visual Basic).

## Razor Keywords
* functions
* inherits
* model
* section
* helper (Not supported by ASP.NET Core.)

A few very important advantages of Razor pages,
1. It supports cross-platform, hence it can be deployed on Windows, Unix, and Mac operating systems.
2. It is easy to learn.
3. Lightweight and flexible framework so it can fit with any application you want to build.
4. Can work with C# programming language with Razor markup.
5. More organized with code behind page like asp.net web forms.

## ASP.NET Razor Code Blocks

Code block is used to enclose C# code statements. It starts with @ (at) character and is enclosed by {} (curly braces). Unlike expressions, C# code inside code blocks is not rendered. The default language in a code block is C#, but we can transit back to HTML. HTML within a code block will be rendered as HTML.
