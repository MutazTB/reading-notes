# LINQ

LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.
It is through a set of extensions, LINQ ably integrates queries in C# and Visual Basic. This tutorial offers a complete insight into LINQ with ample examples and coding.

To write the LINQ Query, we need the following three things:

1. Data Source (in-memory objects, SQL, XML)
2. Query
3. Execution of the Query

## What is a Query?
A query is nothing but a set of instructions. Queries are applied to the data source (i.e., in-memory object, SQL, XML, etc.) to perform the operations (i.e., CRUD operations) and show the shape of the output from that Query.

Each Query is a combination of three things; they are:

1. Initialization(to work with a particular data source)
2. Condition(where, filter, sorting condition)
3. Selection (single selection, group selection or joining)
---

## We can use LINQ queries in two ways:

1. Query Syntax
2. Method Syntax

**Note**

Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times.
