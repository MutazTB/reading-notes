# Collections

collection represents group of objects. By the help of collections, we can perform various operations on objects such as :
1. store object
2. update object
3. delete object
4. retrieve object
5. search object
6. sort object

## Types of Collections 

1. System.Collections.Generic classes.
The System.Collections.Generic namespace has following classes:
[List , Stack , Queue , LinkedList , HashSet , SortedSet ]

2. System.Collections classes (Now deprecated)
***These classes are legacy.***
It is suggested now to use System.Collections.Generic classes. The System.Collections namespace has following classes:
[ArrayList , Stack , Queue , Hashtable ]

3. System.Collections.Concurrent classes.
The System.Collections.Concurrent namespace provides classes for thread-safe operations. Now multiple threads will not create problem for accessing the collection items.
The System.Collections.Concurrent namespace has following classes:
[BlockingCollection , ConcurrentBag , ConcurrentStack , ConcurrentQueue , ConcurrentDictionary , Partitioner , Partitioner , OrderablePartitioner ]

# Enum
Enum in C# is also known as enumeration. It is used to store a set of named constants such as season, days, month, size etc.

The enum constants are also known as enumerators.
Enum constants has default values which starts from 0 and incremented to one by one. But we can change the default value.

**Points to remember**
1. enum has fixed set of constants
2. enum improves type safety
3. enum can be traversed
