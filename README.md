### Terminal
[TERMINAL Tutorial](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/4339683/assignments/28365168)
In this section I learned about main concepts involved in using the command line:
1. Basic Navigation
    - pwd => Where am I in the system.
    - ls [path] Perform a listing of the given path or your current directory.
        - Common options: -l, -h, -a
    - Path => A description of where a file or directory is on the filesystem.
2. More About Files
    - file [path] => Find out what type of item a file or directory is. 
    - Hidden files and directories => A name beginning with a . (dot) is considered hidden.
3. Manual Pages
    - man <command> => View the man page for a command.
    - man -k <search term> => Search for man pages containing the search term.
    - Press q to exit man pages
4. File Manipulation
    - mkdir <directory name> => Create a directory
    - rmdir <directory name> => Remove a directory (only if empty).
    - touch <file name> => Create a blank file.
    - cp <source> <destination> => Copy the source file to the destination.
    - mv <source> <destination> => Move the source file to the destination
        - May also be used to rename files or directories.
    - rm <path> => Remove a file or directory.
        - Common options: -r -f
**Note** [something] indicates an optional value. <something> indicates a compulsory value.
